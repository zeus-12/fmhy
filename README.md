## What needs to be fixed | Open issues

### Common

- reset scroll to zero upon changing wiki category: seems to be an open nextjs issue => try using the workarounds.
- add sitemap, all that good seo stuff
- add piracy glossary somewhere.

### Design

- TYPOGRAPHY => spend some time on fixing the typography => look into shadcn-typography. better replace mantine w. shadcn. (toc drawer also needs a new design)
- toc drawer looks ugly.

### Markdown related

- see if dom issues can be fixed eg: (Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `inline`.), probably can be fixed w. some remark package.
- for links hardcode reddit mappings to the corresponding page on the website.
- move all the notestarters,warningstarters,etc form all differetn renderers logic to single place: (`LiRenderer` is working fine => abstract the logic from there, and reuse)

### Search

- add a "copy item as markdown" button right next to each entry in search.
- use react-virtualised, and remove limits for the search
- highlight the word searched => use any of the syntaxhighlighting extensions for react-markdown for this
- check the `minisearch` see if its good enough to replace flexsearch => esp the fuzzysearch
